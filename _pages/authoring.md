My name is Timothy Stewart, I am currently a Research Engineer at Signature Research Inc. as well as
a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute for Human Machine Cognition - University of
West Florida joint program located in Pensacola, Florida. In my freetime I enjoy drone videography
and photography, creating content for The Blog and YouTube and keeping it balanced by running it all
off on the sandy white beaches where I live.
