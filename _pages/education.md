My name is Timothy Stewart, I am a Software Engineer at ï£¿ Apple, as well as a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute for Human Machine Cognition - University of West Florida joint program in Pensacola, Florida. In my free time I enjoy writing, making gourmet PB sandwiches, drone videography and photography; creating content for The Blog and YouTube, then keeping it balanced by running it off ~~on the sandy white beaches where I live.~~ in the Redwood filled mountains of Silicon Valley where I live.
