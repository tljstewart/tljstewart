I opertate a community outreach brand called [**Elevate**](https://tljstewart.com).

The **Elevate** mission is to cultivate a culture of compassion and creativity for communities to connect and thrive.

We seek to inspire personal growth and local development through organized events and public speaking on STEM, Art, Athletics and Entrepreneurship.

We sponsor and mentor youth programs, especially for children in the Foster Care System, raising funds annually for scholarships.

 The **Dianna Japenga Foster Love Scholarship** is awarded to foster kids that show an aptitude and desire for creativity, compassion and motivation to pursue higher education in a STEAM field to *Elevate* their community.
